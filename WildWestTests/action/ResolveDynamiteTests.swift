/**
 Dynamite
 Play this card in front of you: the Dynamite will stay there for a whole turn.
 When you start your next turn (you have the Dynamite already in play),
 before the first phase you must “draw!”:
 - if you draw a card showing Spades and a number between 2 and 9, the
 Dynamite explodes! Discard it and lose 3 life points;
 - otherwise, pass the Dynamite to the player on your left
 (who will “draw!” on his turn, etc.).
 Players keep passing the Dynamite around until it explodes,
 with the effect explained above, or it is drawn or discarded by a
 Panic! or a Cat Balou. If you have both the Dynamite and a Jail
 in play, check the Dynamite first. If you are damaged (or even
 eliminated!) by a Dynamite, this damage is not considered to
 be caused by any player
