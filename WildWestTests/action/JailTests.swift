/**
 Jail
 Play this card in front of any player regardless of the distance:
 you put him in jail! If you are in jail, you must “draw!” before
 the beginning of your turn:
 - if you draw a Heart card, you escape from jail: discard the
 Jail, and continue your turn as normal;
 - otherwise discard the Jail and skip your turn.
 If you are in Jail you remain a possible target for BANG!
 cards and can still play response cards (e.g. Missed! and
 Beer) out of your turn, if necessary.
 Jail cannot be played on the Sheriff.
