/// If you are in jail, you must “draw!” before the beginning of your turn:
/// - if you draw a Heart card, you escape from jail: discard the Jail, and continue your turn as normal;
/// - otherwise discard the Jail and skip your turn.
/// If you are in Jail you remain a possible target for BANG! cards
/// and can still play response cards (e.g. Missed! and Beer) out of your turn, if necessary.
/// Jail cannot be played on the Sheriff.
